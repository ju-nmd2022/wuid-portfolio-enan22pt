        <h2>Hey!</h2>
        <p>🌕 My name is Bianca<br />
            🌖 I am currently 19 years old<br />
            🌗 I am from the Balkans, more precisely Romania =)
        </p>
        <h3>What am I doing here?</h3>
        <p>🌘 I truly believe that studying abroad is the best choice for me because 
            I will have a chance to meet new people and discover a different culture,
             change my entire environment and move out of my comfort zone, 
            which I think is where most people tend to produce their best work.</p>
         <h4>What I enjoy!</h4>
         <p>❤️ My way of enjoying my time is by listening to music<br />
            Some of my favorite bands are Arctic Monkeys, BABYMETAL, Bring Me The Horizon, Bullet For My Valentine, 
            Deftones, Disturbed, Ghost, Slipknot and System Of A Down.<br />
         ❤️ When I feel creative I like to invest my energy into drawing.<br />
         ❤️ I like watching anime <br />
         ❤️ Gaming (even though I'm not the best=)<br />
         ❤️ I have a big passion for folklore, legends and mythical creatures.
